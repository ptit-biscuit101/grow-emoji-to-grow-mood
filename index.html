					<h2>🎮 Grow Emoji – How to Play</h2>
					<p>
						Welcome to Grow Emoji, the game where one simple click can change
						everything!<br />
						Your mission is simple:
					</p>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span>👉 Click on the emoji.</span> Each time you click, the emoji
						grows bigger and its mood changes. Sometimes it’s happy, sometimes
						angry, sometimes super chill… you never know what’s coming next!
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>✨ But that’s not all:</span> every click also gives you score
						points. The more you click, the more points you earn, and those
						points are super valuable.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>💰 With your score,</span> you can unlock and buy new moods
						for your emoji. Collect them all, switch between them, and show off
						your favorite vibe.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>🔥 The challenge is endless:</span> keep clicking, keep
						growing, keep unlocking. The higher your score, the crazier the
						moods you can get.
					</li>
				</ul>
